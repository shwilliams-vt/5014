            <h2>Pre-Graduate Work</h2>
            
            <h3>Audio Development</h3>

            <p>I began working on audio plugins in 2020, specifically in the <a href="https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vst3sdk">VST</a> format written in C++. One major motivating factor was that I am a music producer and was interested in developing my own music plugins. I also believe there is a giant paywall around much of the current work in audio plugin development, specifically regarding implementation. Part of my mission in developing VST plugins is to promote accessibility to knowledge of these topics for audio plugin developers. </p>
        
            <h3>Virtual/Extended Reality</h3>

            <p>My first experience with extended reality was as a game developer with <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity3D</a>, which I began working in ~2012. Eventually, I was introduced to <a href="https://people.cs.vt.edu/~gracanin/home/Home.html">Dr. Denis Grac&#780;anin</a> at Virginia Tech, who provided me with the opportunity to learn and develop research projects in extended reality environments. He has graciously accepted the role as my advisor in the M.S. program at Virginia Tech.   </p>
        
            <p>In the summer of 2022, I worked with the <a href="https://lib.vt.edu/research-teaching/aries.html">ARIES</a> Lab at Virginia Tech, working on a virtual reality application used to explore animal musculo-skeletal models in an immersive environment. The project was implemented in JavaScript with the <a href="https://threejs.org/">THREE.js</a> API. Personally, this is my favorite way of developing virtual reality applications in the web browser! </p>
        
            <h3>Web Prototyping with JavaScript</h3>

            <p>A frequent hobby of mine is to prototype a wide variety of web applications in JavaScript for easy deployment in the web browser. JavaScript provides a high-level, easy-to-code, portable language to prototype applications targeted for deployment on the web/web browsers. With exciting developments in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">WebAudioAPI</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API">WebGL</a> APIs and standards for web browsers, more innovative and orthogonal applications can be developed and easily accessed on the web/in a web browser as opposed to needing to download similar apps as done in the past.  </p>
