            <h3>Spring 2023 Graduate Teaching Assistanceship</h3>

            <p>This past semester (Spring 2023), I was a Graduate Teaching Assistant for the Computer Science class of Intro to Computer Organization (CS2505) at Virginia Tech. In the course, I worked 15 hours of in-person office hours per week. The work was most rewarding when I got to help students succeed, like when I would see their eyes light up when they finally got the solution. Using the Socratic Method and visualization for learning, I believe my teaching style helped students better understand complicated topics in the C programming language, assembly code, and program logic.</p>
